# the-ultimate-api

A full stack web application for Smash Ultimate loving devs who want to incorporate raw stats into their own applications.

## Why build this?

Smash Ultimate is an excellent contender for my favorite game, so I made a [frame data viewing app](https://dresean-sutton.github.io/smashmate/) for it. I pulled my data from the best Smash API on the market, the [KuroganeHammer API](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer). However, it is outdated and unmaintained for Smash Ultimate. In an effort to fill the gap for me and other developers, I decided to build my own RESTful API and give back to the Smash community.
